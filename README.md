# Pewlitt-Hackard-Analysis

Determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

# Results

1. The total number of employees reaching retirement is 72,458. This number is quite large and the company needs to start the hiring process soon to fill future vacanies.

2. The job title with the highest number of employees reaching retirement is Senior Engineer at 25916, followed by Senior Staff at 24926.
